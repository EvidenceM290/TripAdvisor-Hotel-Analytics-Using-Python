# TripAdvisor-Hotel-Analytics-Using-Python
# Description: 
This project leverages Python to explore and analyze hotel data from TripAdvisor. The dataset includes various attributes such as hotel type, visitor origins, subscription status, and traffic data. By using Python's data analysis libraries, I performed tasks such as data cleaning, outlier detection, missing value imputation, and visualizations. This project addresses key business questions such as hotel subscriptions by country, traffic distribution analysis, and visitor behavior by country of origin.

# Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Outlier Detection: Utilized Python functions to clean data, detect outliers, and handle missing values using imputation techniques.
Visualizations: Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore traffic by hotel type, along with log-transformed traffic data to analyze distributions.
Statistical Analysis: Performed grouped analysis to calculate subscription proportions across different countries, and identified popular destinations for Chinese and French visitors based on review data.
Business Insights: Extracted valuable insights related to hotel types and customer demographics, which can be used for strategic marketing decisions.
Tools & Technologies:

# Python Programming
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization
CSV file handling and statistical analysis using Python libraries
